# Voxellight Ultralight SDKs

This repository simply hosts Ultralight SDK binaries for use with [Voxellight](https://github.com/Ayydxn/Voxellight). This only exists because:
1. The DigitalOcean Spaces server which [apparenetly holds the "latest" version of SDK](https://github.com/ultralight-ux/Ultralight?tab=readme-ov-file#eyes-getting-the-latest-sdk) is actually out of date and the latest build is from 2019.
